This is an introductory programming problem for a deep learning course from Tinkoff.

The code consists of essentially two parts: the Levenshtein distance and the ML.

In the ML part I've fitted my model (gradient boosting on trees) for binary classification with following labels:

1 - source code

0 - plagiarized code

Using ast (Abstract Syntax Tree) module I've got some new features from the codes in addition to the Levenshtein distance.
